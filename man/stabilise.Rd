\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing an outcome variable to be permuted.}

\item{outcome}{The outcome as a string (i.e. "y").}

\item{boot_reps}{The number of bootstrap samples. Default is "auto" which selects number based on dataframe size.}

\item{permutations}{The number of times to be permuted per repeat. Default is "auto" which selects number based on dataframe size.}

\item{perm_boot_reps}{The number of times to repeat each set of permutations. Default is 5.}

\item{models}{The models to select for stabilising. Default is elastic net (models = c("enet")), other available models include "lasso", "mbic", "mcp".}

\item{type}{The type of model, either "linear" or "logistic"}
}
\value{
A list for each model selected. Each list contains a dataframe of variable stabilities, a numeric permutation threshold, and a dataframe of coefficients for both bootstrap and permutation.
}
\description{
Function to calculate stability of variables' association with an outcome for a given model over a number of bootstrap repeats
